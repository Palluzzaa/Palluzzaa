## Who I am

Hi! I'm @Palluzzaa, a Computer Science student. I am currently studying C at university, my first programming language, and I am deepening my skills.

## Tips
If you have any suggestions on which programming languages or technologies should I study after doing C, I would be happy to receive them!

Thanks for visiting!
